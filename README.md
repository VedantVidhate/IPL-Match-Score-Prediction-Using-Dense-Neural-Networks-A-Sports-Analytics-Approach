# IPL Match Score Prediction Using Dense Neural Networks

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive approach to predicting IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket match scores using dense neural networks. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this project aims to build a predictive model that forecasts match scores based on various match features and statistics.

## Project Structure
The project repository consists of the following key components:

- **`IPL_Score_Prediction.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the step-by-step implementation of data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
- **`ipl_data.csv`**: The dataset file containing historical IPL match data used for training and validating the model.
- **`README.md`**: This document providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage details.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data to ensure it is suitable for model training.
- **Model Architecture**: A dense neural network built using `TensorFlow` and `Keras` for effective score prediction.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance metrics and evaluation techniques to assess the predictive accuracy.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VedantVidhate/IPL-Match-Score-Prediction-Using-Dense-Neural-Networks-A-Sports-Analytics-Approach.git
   cd IPL-Match-Score-Prediction-Using-Dense-Neural-Networks-A-Sports-Analytics-Approach
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
   Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.7 or higher). Install the necessary dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook IPL_Score_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

## Dataset
The project uses an IPL dataset (`ipl_data.csv`) containing historical match data, including features such as team names, match locations, innings details, and more.

## Model Details
The dense neural network model comprises multiple layers, including:
- **Input Layer**: Accepts match features.
- **Hidden Layers**: Fully connected dense layers with ReLU activation functions.
- **Dropout Layers**: Used to prevent overfitting.
- **Output Layer**: Produces the predicted match score.

## Training
The model is trained using the `Adam` optimizer and `mean squared error` as the loss function for accurate regression performance. The notebook provides comprehensive visualization of the training process and performance metrics.

## Results
The performance of the model is evaluated using common metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE). Graphs and plots are used to visualize the model's predictions against actual values for better understanding.

## Future Improvements
Potential enhancements include:
- Using more complex neural network architectures or ensembles for better performance.
- Incorporating real-time data for live match predictions.
- Experimenting with additional feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy.
